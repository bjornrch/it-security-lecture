### Description

Fireball is a browser hijacker and was discovered by an israelian software company. They found out, that 250 million computers all around the world were infected and 1/5 of company networks as well[^1]. Fireball takes over your browser and imitates a real browser. That is why you can't no longer echange your browser settings after you have been infected. As well as that it redirects your real browser and shows advertisements on every website. As well as that it collects data from users. Fireball prevents itself from being removed by anti-malware software. Besides that, Fireball can install browser extension and execute code on your computer which makes this adware very dangerous [^2].
